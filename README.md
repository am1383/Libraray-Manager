## C++ Beginning Course Project

### Library Management System with File and Map Integration

#### Description:

This project is a simple library management system implemented in C++ that utilizes file I/O and the std::map data structure. It allows users to add, delete, edit, and view books in a library. The project aims to provide a practical example for utilizing file systems and working with classes in C++.

#### Features:

Add Book: Users can add new books to the library by providing details such as book name, author, and serial number.
Delete Book: Books can be deleted from the library by specifying the serial number of the book.
Edit Book: Users can edit the details of existing books, such as updating the book name or author.
View Books: The system allows users to view the list of all books currently in the library.
Technologies Used:

Sold Book:The system can allows users to buy book and move book file to archive and remove from library storage.

#### C++ programming language

File Input/Output (I/O)
std::map data structure for efficient storage and retrieval of book information
Object-oriented programming principles using classes
Project Structure:

main.cpp: Contains the main program logic, user interface, and interaction with the library management system.
Library.h: Header file containing the declaration of the Library class, which manages the book operations.
Library.cpp: Source file containing the implementation of the Library class functions, including adding, deleting, editing, and viewing books.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the source files using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
Run the compiled executable file.
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various library operations, such as adding, deleting, editing, and viewing books.
